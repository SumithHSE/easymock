    <h2>A moment of history</h2>

    <p>
        EasyMock has been created by <a href="mailto:lists@tammofreese.de" target="_blank">Tammo Freese</a> at OFFIS in
        2001. It was originally allowing to only mock
        interfaces but was a providing type safe mocking. A great revolution at that time.
    </p>

    <p>
        The so-called class extension allowing class mocking appeared in 2003. It was initially developed
        by Joel Shellman, Chad Woolley and <a href="http://blog.tremblay.pro" target="_blank">Henri Tremblay</a> on the files
        section of <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/group/easymock" target="_blank">Yahoo!Groups</a>. It was based on an idea of Bob Lee. It has been merged in the EasyMock core in 2010.
    </p>

    <p>
        EasyMock developments are now led by <a href="http://blog.tremblay.pro" target="_blank">Henri Tremblay</a>. He is helped
        by Alistair Todd and <a href="http://agilespirit.github.io/" target="_blank">Jérémy Buget</a> who did the actual version of the website.
